# symmetry-in-fractals
Small application to show the rotational, reflective, and scale symmetries of the Gosper Island and the Sierpinski's Triangle.

## Motivation & Description

Symmetry is a large topic in mathematics. Understanding of symmetry can be vastly improved with visual aids. This program is designed for a high-school level audience to interact with two types of fractals: the Gosper's Island, and the Sierpinski's Triangle. These were chosen because they exhibit different types of symmetry. The Gosper's Island formally displays gyroscopic and scale symmetry. Sierpinski's Triangle displays reflective and rotational symmetry. Full details on the mathematics is found in the file titled _Project Description.pdf_.

The program allows the user to rotate the objects, create tile outlines, create mirror lines, pan, and zoom around each shape. 


## Running the Program

The program can be run simply by downloading _symmetry_and_fractals_ and opening the file. 

On Apple devices, users may be prompted with a message that '“symmetry_and_fractals” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer'. This can be fixed by navigating to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, and then clicking "Open Anyway" where it reads '"symmetry_and_fractals was blocked...'.
