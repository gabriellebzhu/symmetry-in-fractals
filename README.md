# symmetry-in-fractals
Small application to show the rotational, reflective, and scale symmetries of the Gosper Island and the Sierpinski's Triangle.

## Motivation & Description

Symmetry is a large topic in mathematics. Understanding of symmetry can be vastly improved with visual aids. This program is designed for a high-school level audience to interact with two types of fractals: the Gosper's Island, and the Sierpinski's Triangle. These were chosen because they exhibit different types of symmetry. The Gosper's Island formally displays gyroscopic and scale symmetry. Sierpinski's Triangle displays only
